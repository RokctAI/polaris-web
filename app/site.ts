/**
 * Single source of truth for this shell's public identity: the origin it is
 * served from and the name it calls itself.
 *
 * Both come from the deployment, never from code:
 *
 *   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL   the public origin (no trailing slash). Unset, the
 *                          shell falls back to Vercel's production URL, then
 *                          to localhost - the same resolution base_sdk's
 *                          app/lib/site-metadata.ts applies to metadataBase,
 *                          so /robots.txt and /sitemap.xml agree with the
 *                          link-preview cards.
 *   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME  the name the wordmark and the web app manifest
 *                          print. Unset, it is the app_type this repo was
 *                          spawned with (.rokct/config/app_type), which is
 *                          also the registry template's name.
 *
 * No product copy lives here: the <title>, description and preview cards are
 * the home SDK's, registered into base_sdk's site-metadata registry at
 * compose time (components/custom/landing/site-metadata.ts).
